If you want to run with RPC, please add more flags accordingly:

`gmc --rpc --rpcapi="db,eth,net,web3,personal" --rpcport "8545" --rpcaddr "127.0.0.1" --rpccorsdomain "localhost" console`

## Can't find peers to sync?
Musicoin has set up some default nodes that you can try to connect as bootstrap nodes. Once connected, the console will start syncing automatically. In case you can't see syncing after a long time, you may have to add peer(s) manually.

In GMC console, add knowing peer with its enode information:
`> admin.addPeer("{enode info}")`
